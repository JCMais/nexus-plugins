This plugin adds the following to the `GraphQL` schema generated by nexus:

- `Node` interface
- `node($id: ID!): Node` field on `Query`
- `nodes($ids: [ID!]!): Node!` field on `Query`

The plugin itself accepts a few configuration options:

### idFetcher [required]

A function with signature `(idValue, ctx, info) => Object`, which should return the node for given `idValue`

### resolveType [required]

A function with signature `(object) => string | GraphQLType`, which should return the GraphQL type for the given object. This is basically the resolveType of the `Node` interface created by the plugin.

### idParser

A function with signature `(id) => any`. It will be called with the ID passed to the `node` / `nodes` fields, and their result will be used as the first argument passed to `idFetcher` above. By default this is set to `fromGlobalId` from `graphql-relay`.
